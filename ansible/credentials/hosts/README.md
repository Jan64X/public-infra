# Host-Specific Credentials Directory

This directory contains credentials generated for each managed host.

## Structure

Each host has its own subdirectory named after the inventory hostname.
All service-specific secrets live alongside the user passwords — one directory per host,
not per service:

```
hosts/
  └── oraclevps/
      ├── root_pass.txt
      ├── ansible_pass.txt
      ├── jan64x_pass.txt
      ├── searxng_secret_key.txt
      └── salts/
          ├── root_salt.txt
          ├── ansible_salt.txt
          └── jan64x_salt.txt
```

## Service-Specific Credentials

- `searxng_secret_key.txt` — SearXNG secret key (auto-generated)

These are automatically generated by Ansible playbooks and stored securely. Do not delete unless performing a fresh installation.
